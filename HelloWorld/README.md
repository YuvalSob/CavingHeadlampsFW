## Here you can find all the FW for learning Driver progaming basics ##

## [Blink](https://github.com/YuvalSob/CavingHeadlampsFW/blob/main/HelloWorld/Blink.ino)
A very basic FW, only blinks 2 LED on pin 5 and 6 to see everting is connected correctly

## [MicroMo](https://github.com/YuvalSob/CavingHeadlampsFW/blob/main/HelloWorld/MicroMo.ino)
A very basic FW, Turn on/off LEDs according to switch

## [ADC](https://github.com/YuvalSob/CavingHeadlampsFW/blob/main/HelloWorld/ADC.ino)
Analog Digital Converter - AKA battery check

A basic FW to understand voltage measurment 
* This FW is also used to calibrate ACD values for all other FWs' battary check function

## [PWM](https://github.com/YuvalSob/CavingHeadlampsFW/blob/main/HelloWorld/PWM.ino)
Pulse Width modulation - AKA LED dimming

A basic FW to understand LED dimming 

## [Sleep](https://github.com/YuvalSob/CavingHeadlampsFW/blob/main/HelloWorld/Sleep.ino)

A basic FW to understand entering sleep mode to save power while light is off
